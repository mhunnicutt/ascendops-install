// Department layer for the cockpit. Maps a human department to the agent that
// runs it (by systemName / filesystem key). Plain data — no React imports — so
// it is safe to consume from both server components and the client sidebar.
//
// The `agent` field ships EMPTY by default: each org fills in which of its own
// agents runs each department. The department view renders an empty agent as a
// "not yet stood up / to build" config-prompt, so the dashboard is usable before
// any agents are assigned. (A build-time codegen from the org roster is a planned
// follow-up so this can auto-populate from the members' actual roster.)
