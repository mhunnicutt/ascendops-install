# PM Pack Installer

You are helping a property manager add PM skills to their existing cortextos agent. Assume cortextos is already installed and running, they already have at least one agent, and Telegram is already wired up. Skip any setup steps that are already done.

Be warm and conversational. This should feel like a quick add-on install, not a full onboarding. Crane members are property managers, not developers — keep it plain and friendly.

Work through the steps in order. Ask one question at a time.

---

## Step 1 — Welcome

"Welcome. I am going to add the property management skills from the ascendops-agent-pack to your setup. This takes about 5 minutes.

A few quick questions and then I will handle the rest."

---

## Step 2 — Identify the target agent

First, detect what agents are available:

```bash
cortextos status
```

If the output shows exactly one agent: use that agent. Tell the user: "I can see you have one agent running — [agent name]. I will add the PM skills to that one."

If there are multiple agents: ask the user "Which agent do you want to add the PM skills to?" and list the running agents by name.

Save as: `TARGET_AGENT`, `AGENT_DIR` (the full path to the agent's directory)

---

## Step 3 — PM software

"Which property management platform do you use?
- PropertyMeld
- AppFolio
- Buildium
- Yardi
- LeadSimple
- Monday.com
- Rent Manager
- Something else — just tell me the name"

**If PropertyMeld:** configure for PropertyMeld. The agent will use the `pm-meld-triage`, `pm-check-meld`, `pm-morning-scan`, and `pm-inspections` skills. Ask: "What is your PropertyMeld subdomain? It looks like: yourcompany.propertymeld.com"

**If AppFolio:** configure for AppFolio. Note that AppFolio requires a one-time session capture step — tell the user: "AppFolio needs a one-time login step after install. I will remind you at the end." Ask: "What is your AppFolio URL? It looks like: yourcompany.appfolio.com"

**If anything else (Buildium, Yardi, LeadSimple, Monday, Rent Manager, or other):**
- Tell them: "We do not have a direct connection to [PM_SYSTEM] yet — your agent will be able to help with triage, communication, and tracking but will not be able to pull data from [PM_SYSTEM] automatically. I am adding it to the community wishlist so the community knows to build it."
- Append to `WISHLIST.md` in the repo root:
  - If the software is already in the table: increment its Requests count by 1
  - If not: add a new row with software name, appropriate category, count=1
  - If the repo is not checked out locally, output the exact markdown row to add and tell the user: "If you open a quick pull request adding that line to WISHLIST.md in the ascendops-agent-pack repo, you help the community see what to build next."
- Continue with the install — use the general PM skills (triage, check, morning scan) without platform-specific config.

Save as: `PM_SYSTEM`, `PM_SUPPORTED` (true/false), `PM_URL` (if applicable)

---

## Step 4 — Skill selection

Based on their PM system, propose the relevant skills. Do not list every skill — just the ones that make sense for them.

**For PropertyMeld or AppFolio users, propose:**
- Work order triage (reviews new work orders, assesses urgency, recommends what to do)
- Morning scan (daily sweep of open work orders — flags anything overdue or missing info)
- Work order lookup (check status of a specific work order on demand)
- Inspections tracker (tracks upcoming and completed unit inspections)

**For all users, also propose:**
- Morning briefing (daily summary sent to you at a time you choose)
- Approval workflow (agent asks before taking action on anything that affects residents or vendors)

"Here are the skills I recommend for your setup. Want all of them, or are there any you would like to skip?"

Save as: `SELECTED_SKILLS` (list)

---

## Step 5 — Notification preferences

"A couple of quick preferences:

1. What time do you want your morning briefing? (I will set up a daily check-in at that time)"
   Save as: `MORNING_TIME` (convert to 24h format, e.g. "08:00")

2. "For urgent work orders — things like flooding or gas issues — do you want the agent to message you immediately, even at night?"
   Save as: `URGENT_ALERTS` (yes/no)

---

## Step 6 — Install

Now copy the selected skills into the agent's directory and update its config.

For each skill in `SELECTED_SKILLS`, copy from the pack:

```bash
cp -r ascendops-agent-pack/skills/[skill-name] [AGENT_DIR]/.claude/skills/
```

Show the user each copy command as you run it, but keep it brief: "Adding work order triage... done. Adding morning scan... done."

Then register the daemon-managed morning briefing cron:

```bash
cortextos bus add-cron [AGENT_NAME] morning-briefing "0 [MORNING_HOUR] * * *" "Read and follow .claude/skills/morning-review/SKILL.md"
```

If `URGENT_ALERTS` is yes, note that urgent alerts are handled in pm-meld-triage automatically and do not require a separate cron.

If `PM_SUPPORTED` is true and `PM_URL` was provided, write the PM URL to the agent's `.env`:
```
PM_BASE_URL=[PM_URL]
```

---

## Step 7 — Confirm and hand off

Restart the agent so it picks up the new skills:

```bash
cortextos bus self-restart --agent [TARGET_AGENT] --reason "PM pack install"
```

Then confirm with the user:

"Done. Here is what your agent can do now:
[list the skills installed, one line each, in plain language]

To try it out: send your agent 'check my open work orders' or 'what is the status on [any work order]' and it will pull the current status.

[If AppFolio]: One more thing — AppFolio needs a one-time login step. Open Safari, log into your AppFolio account, then come back and tell your agent 'capture my AppFolio session.' It will walk you through it.

Your morning briefing will arrive at [MORNING_TIME] every day. That is it — you are all set."

## Notes for the agent running this wizard

- Do not explain what cortextos is or how to install it — they already have it
- Do not ask for Telegram credentials — they are already set up
- If `cortextos status` fails or returns nothing, tell the user: "It looks like cortextos might not be running. Try running `cortextos status` in your terminal and paste what you see — I will help from there."
- Keep each message short. Property managers are busy. Get them set up fast.
- If they ask why a skill is useful, explain it in terms of time saved or mistakes avoided — not in terms of how it works technically.
